A digital electoral infrastructure designed to synchronize voter data across states, reduce duplication, enable voter mobility, and support secure, transparent elections.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Large-scale elections face challenges due to fragmented, state-wise electoral rolls, leading to duplicate voter records, outdated data, and exclusion of migrant voters. There is a need for a secure, interoperable system that ensures accuracy, prevents duplication, and allows eligible citizens to vote irrespective of their location.
